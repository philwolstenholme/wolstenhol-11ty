# wolstenhol-11ty

[https://wolstenhol.me](https://wolstenhol.me)

My personal site, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), [eleventy-plugin-vue](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-vue), Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.

Partially based on [eastslopestudio/eleventy-starter](https://github.com/eastslopestudio/eleventy-starter).

## Alternative versions of the site (no CSS or no JavaScript)

There's still plenty of room for improvement, but I'm pretty pleased with the work I've done so far on making sure that this website uses semantic markup and progressive enhancement.

To demonstrate this, you can view a [version of the website without CSS](https://wolstenhol.me/index.no-css) and a [version of the website without JavaScript](https://wolstenhol.me/index.no-js) to see how it behaves.
