## Vite migration

- [x] Tailwind purging
- [ ] Serviceworker
- [x] How to lazyload main.js
- [ ] Allow custom inputs alongside Eleventy's [although this is less important now]
- [ ] HTML minification but also blurry Instagram placeholders
- [ ] `<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/main.css" /></noscript>` for no-JS users (needed due to Critical CSS)

## CSS

- Go through old Vue templates and replace scoped CSS with utilities or custom CSS

## Eleventy

- Move speaking data to a collection?
- Sort out page templates for homepage vs other pages
- FINISH portfolio section from local feature branch

## Accessibility

- Review how linked cards work, e.g. have only the heading be a link and handle clicks elsewhere via JS (to reduce SR verbosity)
