# Todo

## JavaScript

## CSS

- Go through old Vue templates and replace scoped CSS with utilities or custom CSS

## Eleventy

- Move speaking data to a collection?
- Sort out page templates for homepage vs other pages
- FINISH portfolio section from local feature branch

## Accessibility

- Make invisible scroller items inert (e.g. as per https://inclusive-components.design/a-content-slider/#handlinglinkedcontent)
- Review how linked cards work, e.g. have only the heading be a link and handle clicks elsewhere via JS (to reduce SR verbosity)
- If input intent is keyboard show all Instagram captions
