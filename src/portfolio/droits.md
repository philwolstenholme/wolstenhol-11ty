- Working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to prototype a GDS app for reporting wreck material and supporting its move into an Alpha and then Beta service
- Designed and build a process using the GDS prototyping kit to collect details of collected material from shipwrecks, assisted in user research, and refined the prototype
- Used Express, Node.js, Nunjucks, and Leaflet for mapping
- The service passed its GDS Alpha service assessment on its first attempt, and I was involved in the presentation to the assessors
