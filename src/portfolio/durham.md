- Designing and building an HTML prototype of a complete website overhaul
- The actual development was carried out by Terminal Four within their CMS platform
- This introduced an interesting limitation â€“ we had switched to a very declarative, markup-centric approach (Vue, Tailwind etc) but T4's templating system was much more set up for a _'here are some very specific CSS classes and some nested `<ul>` elements, now turn it into a megamenu'_ approach
- I presented a section detailing our development approach as part of a team of around five in the succesful pitch for this large contract
