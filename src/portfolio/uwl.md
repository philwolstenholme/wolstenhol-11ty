- Developed a new Drupal theme that incorporated Atomic Design, Pattern Lab, utility-first/atomic CSS (Tailwind), a more modern build process, standardised typographic and spacing scales, and provided (for the first time) a set of reusable components for CTI’s Drupal team. I named the theme after the Manchester-based atomic scientist Ernest Rutherford
- I received feedback years later that the project's frontend still felt very maintainable and easy to dip back into
- Built a progressively decoupled 'course' content type with Vue.js. This presented variants of courses in a dynamic, SPA-like way that didn’t compromise on editor experience, accessibility, or the shareability of URLs
- I spoke about the [progressively decoupled course page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBLlwvM_uPc) in Amsterdam at DrupalCon, my first non-UK conference presentation. My session was the most attended in my time slot (350+ delegates) and one (very kind) YouTube commenter wrote “Brilliant talk. If this guy made a 10 hour series on Drupal & Vue development I’d watch it ASAP”, while another equally kind commenter called it ‘stunning’.
