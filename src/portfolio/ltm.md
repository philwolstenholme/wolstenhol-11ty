- This was a fantastic project working with a great team at LTM
- I led a large part in avoiding and remediating accessibility issues on the site, and working with an external auditor
- I led the development of various components that would feed back into CTI's Voyager product, including search, news, blogs, gated content and more
- As a team we helped develop a web interface for the museum's collection, which saw a **33% increase** in visits after our work
- I worked on the frontend for a new donations system which led to a **20x increase** in donations
