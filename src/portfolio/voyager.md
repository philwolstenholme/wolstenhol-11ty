- Largely created and led the development of Voyager, an internal Drupal distribution, theme, Composer template and set of custom modules that helps CTI deliver fantastic Drupal sites
- Used as the base of all of CTIâ€™s Drupal builds
- Saves 2-3 sprints worth of work by packaging up configuration, modular functionality, a set of pre-built components that are easily re-skinned, patches for common Drupal bugs, and IDE configuration
- Sets standards supported by automatic code linting, formatting, and documentation
- I ensured it worked great in my two main areas of interest: accessibility and front-end performance
