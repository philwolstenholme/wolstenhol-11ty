- Scrapes (via a Netlify function) the Transport for Greater Manchester to show you the time of the last Manchester Metrolink tram home (sorry TFGM!)
- Before I used serverless for this the scraping happened in a nightly run done by a Raspberry Pi in my flat â€“ this got my residential IP banned from TFGM's website, oops!
