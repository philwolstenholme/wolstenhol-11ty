- Used Drupal to deliver designs produced by MMU's own designers
- Worked alongside MMU's in-house developers to provide assistance and review code prior to releasing it on CTI's infrastructure
- The project's internal stakeholders used corporate IT machines that still had IE11 as the default browser, which was a notable constraint!
