- Used Drupal to develop functionality and implement designs produced by MMU's own designers
- Worked alongside MMU's in-house developers to provide assistance and review code prior to releasing it on CTI's infrastructure
- The project's internal stakeholders used corporate IT machines that still had IE11 as the default browser, which was a notable constraint, especially as one requirement was to have different colour themes, which would have been an ideal use for CSS custom properties.
