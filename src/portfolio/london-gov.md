- Worked with the Greater London Authority on everything from their Drupal 7 site, follow up microsites, and their current Drupal 9 site
- The GLA were a great team to work with and this (along with London Transport Museum) was amongst my favourite CTI projects
- The site fell under the The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018
- I created a special version of CTI's base theme (Rutherford) and added Storybook to replace Pattern Lab
- I provided accessibility advice during the planning, design, and the start of the development phase, before I left CTI and joined the Co-op â€” I wish I'd been able to spend more time on this.
