- Worked with the Greater London Authority on everything from their Drupal 7 site, follow up microsites, and their current recently launched Drupal 9 site
- The GLA were a great team to work with and this (along with London Transport Museum) was amongst my favourite CTI projects
- We took CTI Voyager and build a version of it for the GLA to allow them to share elements across multiple different Drupal sites
- I created a special version of CTI's base theme (Rutherford) and added Storybook to replace Pattern Lab
- Used [Style Dictionary to create a design tokens system](https://dev.to/philw_/using-style-dictionary-to-transform-tailwind-config-into-scss-variables-css-custom-properties-and-javascript-via-design-tokens-24h5) for the new GLA theme
- I provided accessibility advice during the planning, design, and the start of the development phase
- My last big bit of CTI work before I joined the Co-op â€” I wish I'd been able to spend more time on this project!
