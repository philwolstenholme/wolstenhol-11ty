- Prototyping a Vue.js inventory tracking app to be used by the Royal Navy onboard aircraft carriers
- Used Vue, Webpack, Vuetify, and Vuex
- Produced a set of reeusable components with a documentation site built with MkDocs and vue-styleguidist
- I visited the HMS Queen Elizabeth docked at Portsmouth to observe user research and shared my work with [a talk at the Manchester Vue.js meetup](https://twitter.com/vuejsmcr/status/1037036688491638784)
- I also almost tripped over a torpedo while in the bowels of an aircraft carrier
